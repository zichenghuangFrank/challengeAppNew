# Weather Report Application

The weather report application consumes a public Weather API which broadcasts the weather in two biggest cities BeiJing and Shanghai.
For this project, we will use 'npm install view-design --save', 'npm install vue-router', 'npm install vue-cookie --save' and 'npm install --save axios vue-axios'.
- Users can download the current weather report as a local .txt file for future review. 
- To have persistent storage, the user can save the current weather report(s) for the selected city as Cookies. 
As the user revisits the application, the application will re-render the saved weather report(s) and display it on the bottom section of the web page.
